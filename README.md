These are automatically made available to you in each respective region.

# Compact View
[Install](https://github.com/tehstone/wayfarer-addons/raw/main/wayfarer-compact-card.user.js)

Removes unnecessary sentences, reduced font size for title/descriptions, automatically defaults all three What is it categories to **NO**. Not necessarily compact.

# Version Display
[Install](https://github.com/tehstone/wayfarer-addons/raw/main/wayfarer-version-display.user.js)

Displays the current Wayfarer code version in the upper left of the page.


# Localstorage Check
[Install](https://github.com/tehstone/wayfarer-addons/raw/main/wayfarer-localstoragecheck.user.js)

On each page load, checks the current amount of data in localstorage and warns if full. For older versions of several add ons that use localstorage this is useful to determine if silent errors are caused by localstorage filling up.

# Upgrade Percentage
[Install](https://github.com/tehstone/wayfarer-addons/raw/main/wayfarer-upgrade-percent.user.js)

Adds a percentage next to the user icon for current upgrade progress. Click on the number to refresh it (use with care, this creates abnormal requests to the Wayfarer site that may appear suspicious to Niantic).

# Legal Stuff
Significant portions of the code within each of the `.user.js` script files in this repository were copied and modified from [Wayfarer+](https://github.com/MrJPGames/WayFarerPlus) and [Wayfarer-Toolkit](https://github.com/AlterTobi/WayFarer-Toolkit). Note that the toolkit code was originally authored by [MrJPGames](https://github.com/MrJPGames) but their repository was removed or made private so this link is to a fork which may no longer match the original code.

Modifications include but are not limited to: rearranging code in order to package similar features together in single scripts, adding additional functionality, removing portions which no longer apply to the updated Wayfarer website.
